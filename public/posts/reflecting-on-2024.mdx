## Introduction

2024 has been a year of profound change and growth, marked by some of the biggest milestones of my life. Moving to **London** and starting my new role at **Cloudflare** are achievements that I couldn’t have imagined a few years ago. Alongside this, I rebranded my women-in-tech community into **DefyDefault**, continued my final semester at the **University of London**, and expanded my professional presence through blogs and networking.

It’s been a year of challenges, victories, and lessons, and I couldn’t be more grateful for the experiences that have shaped me into who I am today.

## A New Chapter: Moving to London and Joining Cloudflare

Relocating to London this year was not just about changing cities—it was about embracing a new culture, environment, and professional opportunity. The highlight of this transition was joining **Cloudflare** as a **Frontend Engineer on the Zero Trust Team**. From the moment I received my offer, I knew this role would be transformative.

Cloudflare’s onboarding process and team culture exceeded my expectations. My colleagues made a concerted effort to ensure I felt welcomed and supported. The thoughtful onboarding process and genuine offers of help quickly made me realize I wasn’t just joining a company—I was joining a community.

One of the most inspiring aspects of this new role is the shared passion and dedication among my teammates. Their kindness, openness, and willingness to collaborate have made me even more determined to contribute my best work. Being surrounded by such a talented and supportive group has reminded me why I love what I do: building technology that empowers people while working alongside incredible individuals who inspire me every day.

Relocating to London wasn’t without its challenges. Navigating a new city, finding a place to live, and settling into the fast-paced rhythm of life in a global hub pushed me out of my comfort zone. However, these challenges also taught me resilience and adaptability—qualities I know will serve me well both personally and professionally.

I’m looking forward to growing in my role at Cloudflare, learning from my peers, and contributing to meaningful projects that align with the company’s mission of creating a better, safer internet. This opportunity has reaffirmed my commitment to pushing boundaries, both as a developer and as a collaborator.

## Breaking Barriers: Rebranding DefyDefault and Hosting an Event

This year also marked a significant milestone for my women-in-tech community. We rebranded **XXIT** into **DefyDefault**, a network that empowers women to break stereotypes and thrive in technology. This rebranding wasn’t just about a new name—it was about redefining our mission and creating a platform that resonates with women.

The highlight of this transformation was hosting our **first DefyDefault event**. As a speaker at the event, I delivered a talk titled: **“How to Land a Global Job Using LinkedIn”**

During my session, I shared actionable strategies based on my own experience of leveraging LinkedIn to secure global opportunities. From building a compelling profile to engaging meaningfully with connections, my goal was to equip attendees with the tools they needed to advance their careers. The enthusiasm and engagement from the audience were incredibly rewarding, and I was inspired by the stories and aspirations they shared.

It was a powerful reminder of the importance of creating spaces where women can connect, learn, and grow together.

## Mentorship and Leadership: Co-Hosting with Seoul Women IT’s

Another highlight of 2024 was co-hosting Seoul Women IT’s Study Crew Season 3 as the first individual host. This opportunity was particularly meaningful as it allowed me to play a key role in shaping the program and bringing my global perspective to a local initiative.

As a **Google Women Techmakers Ambassador**, I contributed to the planning phase by helping structure the program and inviting inspiring international mentors to participate. While the mentoring sessions will officially take place from February to April 2025, the groundwork laid this year set the stage for a meaningful and impactful experience.

Co-hosting this study crew reinforced the importance of mentorship and the impact it can have on individuals’ careers. It also deepened my commitment to creating opportunities for women in tech to learn, connect, and thrive.

Amid all the professional and community-building endeavors, I am currently completing my **final semester at the University of London**. My final project is underway, involving both development and an accompanying report, which I expect to complete by March 2025.

Balancing my studies with everything else happening this year has been challenging but immensely rewarding. The program has equipped me with critical thinking and technical skills that I apply daily as a developer. I’m proud of how far I’ve come academically and excited to see how this chapter shapes my future.

## Expanding My Network: 1,000+ LinkedIn Connections

Networking has been a cornerstone of my career growth this year.

These conversations provided invaluable insights into different industries, career paths, and company cultures.

Each connection represents an opportunity to learn and grow, and I’m deeply grateful for the many people who generously shared their time and knowledge with me.

## Sharing Knowledge: Publishing 12 Blog Posts

Writing has always been a way for me to connect with others, and these blogs allowed me to reach a broader audience while refining my thoughts and communication skills.
