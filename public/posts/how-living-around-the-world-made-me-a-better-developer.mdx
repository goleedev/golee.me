## Introduction

![Coding with a pint in the UK](/posts/living-around-the-world/intro.jpg)

When I first started my journey as a software engineer in **South Korea**, I didn’t anticipate how much <u>my earlier international experiences would shape not just my perspective, but also the way I approach problem-solving, collaboration, and growth in the tech industry</u>. Having spent four formative years each in **China** during middle school and in **the United States** for university, I was exposed to diverse cultures and ways of thinking long before my career began.

These experiences not only shaped my worldview but also fundamentally influenced <u>the way I solve problems, collaborate with others, and approach challenges as a developer</u>.

## Learning to Solve Problems from Different Angles

In China, I was thrown into **a culture of rapid innovation**, where creative problem-solving was a necessity, not an option. I remember being amazed at <u>how people there could stretch limited resources and still build something remarkable</u>. That mindset stuck with me. It helped me navigate fast-paced startup environments where priorities shift daily and technical challenges often come without easy answers.

Contrast that with my time in the United States, where **brainstorming and open collaboration** felt like second nature. In classrooms and workplaces, I learned to <u>value every voice in the room—mine included</u>. For instance, I co-founded and served as **vice president of a club that introduced Korean culture to students in the school**, fostering cross-cultural dialogue and teamwork. This experience not only gave me the <u>confidence to approach challenges with creativity but also solidified my belief in the transformative power of diverse perspectives</u>.

At Uncutgems, a South Korea-based e-commerce startup, I worked as **a founding engineer**, leveraging my experiences in China and the United States to excel in a role that **required extensive collaboration and communication**. One of my most impactful contributions was <u>building an MVP within a week by strategically choosing Supabase and Next.js</u> to balance speed, scalability, and maintainability. This role also demanded significant **creativity**, such as <u>implementing personalized product recommendations using OpenAI’s embedding model</u>, which enhanced user retention by 30% and increased transactions by 15%. These experiences taught me to make swift, effective decisions under pressure while aligning technical trade-offs with business needs.

Now, as I prepare to start a new chapter in the United Kingdom, I look forward to applying these lessons in a global setting. My international experiences have equipped me with <u>the adaptability and collaborative skills to thrive in diverse environments</u>, and I’m eager to continue growing as a developer while contributing to innovative, impactful projects.

## Building Empathy Through Collaboration

Starting XXIT, a women-in-tech community based in South Korea, was a pivotal experience that shaped my ability to approach challenges with a global mindset. While the community was rooted locally, its <u>rapid growth to over 11,500 members and partnerships with global companies</u> like Apple highlighted **how shared goals and values can transcend cultural boundaries**.

Coordinating events and managing such a large community pushed me to **think beyond a single cultural perspective**. For instance, <u>tailoring events and initiatives to meet the varying needs of members</u>, from early-career professionals to industry leaders, required flexibility, active listening, and empathy. These skills deepened further when engaging with partners and speakers from different countries, where effective communication and cultural awareness were crucial.

These lessons have directly influenced my approach as a developer. They’ve taught me to:

- Build solutions that prioritize inclusivity and accessibility.
- Approach technical challenges with a broader understanding of diverse user needs.
- Communicate effectively across teams with varying priorities and cultural contexts.

## Growing Through Cross-Cultural Challenges

Living and working across different countries has consistently challenged me to adapt, not just to new environments but also to unfamiliar ways of working. In South Korea, I learned <u>the value of precision and efficiency while working in fast-paced, high-stakes startup environments</u>. Tight deadlines and limited resources pushed me to deliver solutions that were both practical and scalable.

At Uncutgems, for instance, I took on the challenge of building an e-commerce platform as part of **a two-person development team**. This experience required me to wear **multiple hats—front-end engineer, product thinker, and problem solver**—all while collaborating closely with stakeholders from different professional backgrounds. It taught me how to <u>balance individual creativity with team-driven goals, ensuring that every decision aligned with the larger vision of the company</u>.

These experiences have not only <u>enhanced my technical expertise</u> but also <u>solidified my ability to build impactful, user-centered products in diverse and ever-evolving environments</u>.

## Discovering the Human Side of Technology

One of the most surprising lessons I’ve learned is that technology is far more personal than I ever imagined. I realized this when I started XXIT and saw <u>how technology could bring people together, spark conversations, and inspire change</u>.

One event stands out in particular: a career panel we hosted in Seoul featuring women leaders from top tech companies. The turnout was incredible, and hearing the stories of attendees—some who were just starting their careers, others who had faced significant obstacles—reminded me why I love tech. It’s not just about innovation; it’s about **building bridges and breaking down barriers**.

This realization is what inspired me to rebrand XXIT into **DefyDefault**, a global network for women in tech. I want to <u>continue creating spaces where women from different backgrounds can connect, learn, and grow together</u>. It’s a passion project, but it also shapes how I think about my day-to-day work as a developer. I don’t just want to write good code—I want to build systems and tools that truly empower people.

## Conclusion: Why This Journey Matters

Living in China, the United States, South Korea, and now preparing to work in the United Kingdom, <u>I’ve learned that growth happens at the intersection of discomfort and opportunity</u>. Each country taught me something unique: **adaptability in China, creativity in the US, precision and efficiency in South Korea**, and now the promise of applying these lessons in a global environment in the UK.

These experiences have shaped how I approach challenges as a developer—with adaptability, empathy, and a commitment to building solutions that matter. Whether I’m tackling a complex UI, mentoring aspiring engineers, or growing a global community, <u>I strive to create technology that transcends boundaries and empowers people</u>.

> Because at the end of the day, technology might be a universal language, but it’s our diverse human experiences that truly make it impactful.
