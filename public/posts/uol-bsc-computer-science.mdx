## The UoL Degree Program

![Coursera Introduction](/posts/uol-bsc-computer-science/uol.png)

The University of London (UoL) offers a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science through Coursera, providing flexibility for online learners worldwide. This post explores the program’s structure, benefits, and potential challenges based on my experience.

## Program Overview

In the UK, degrees typically focus on major subjects without general education requirements, making them **three-year programs**. The UoL program follows this model but allows up to **six years to complete**, accommodating various schedules. As a full-time frontend engineer, I opted for the six-year plan, finding it perfect for balancing work and study. Unlike other distance learning programs requiring on-site exams, UoL’s program is entirely online, which suits my busy schedule.

The degree is delivered by faculty from UoL and UoL Goldsmiths and awarded by both institutions. This **global accreditation from a respected English-speaking country** was a key factor in my decision to enroll.

## Admission Criteria

```
- Age: At least 17 years old.
- Mathematical Skills: GCSE Mathematics (Grade A\*-B / 9-5) or AS Level Mathematics (A-E), or equivalent.
- English Proficiency: Specific requirements must be met.
```

![Admission Criteria](/posts/uol-bsc-computer-science/requirements.png)

If you don't meet these criteria, you can still apply via the **Performance-Based Admission (PBA) route** by passing Introduction to Programming I and Computational or Discrete Mathematics with at least 40%. This was my path due to my previous major in communication, which lacked sufficient mathematics courses.

## Tuition Fees

![Tuition Fees](/posts/uol-bsc-computer-science/fee.png)

Tuition varies by nationality. For detailed information, refer to the [fees schedule](https://www.london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/schedules/fees-schedule-computer-science-bsc-2024-25.pdf). For Korean students, each 15-credit module for web-supported learning costs £772, **totaling £3088 for four modules per term**.

---

## Curriculum

Graduation requires completing **24 modules**:

- **Level 4 (Year 1+)**: 8 modules
- **Level 5 (Year 2+)**: 8 modules
- **Level 6 (Year 3+)**: 6 modules
- **Final Project**: 2 modules

Students can transfer to an **on-campus program** in their final year and attend the **graduation ceremony** in person.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:

- **100% Online**: All lectures and exams are online, with some countries now offering fully online exams through Inspera.
- **Active Community**: Many students are IT professionals, facilitating robust networking and information sharing. The student Slack channel and open-source community are very active.
- **Work and Study Balance**: Flexible scheduling makes it feasible to balance work and study.
- **Creative Courses**: Online courses feature creative assignments like game-based tasks and virtual coin trading programs.
- **Coursera Platform**: Easy follow-up on lectures and assignments, with Coursera certificates counting towards course credit.
- **Various Events**: Numerous internship opportunities and webinars are available.

### Cons:

- **Grade Feedback**: There can be significant delays in receiving grades, with feedback often minimal or vague.
- **Communication with the School**: Response times can vary, though I personally haven't experienced delays longer than five days.

## Additional Insights

Based on reader comments, here are some important additional points about the University of London Computer Science degree program:

### Admission Process

- International students may be directed to the Performance-Based Admission (PBA) route due to differences in educational systems, even if they meet stated requirements.
- Older applicants or those who have been away from studying for several years are typically offered only the PBA route.

### Program Structure and Approach

- The program is very hands-on focused, with a strong emphasis on practical learning.
- Mid-module coursework is a key component, pushing students to engage deeply with the content.
- Coursework can be time-intensive, taking days or weeks depending on the module's difficulty level.

### Curriculum Balance

- There are solid foundational mathematics and theory modules early in the program, consistent with typical Computer Science degrees.
- Students are encouraged to thoroughly engage with recommended books (e.g., Sipser, Rosen) for a strong theoretical foundation.
- Advanced topics later in the degree (e.g., data science, machine learning, AI, 3D graphics) focus more on practical application than theoretical depth.
- Some students note a lack of advanced theoretical modules in topics like linear algebra for machine learning and graphics.

### Creative Aspects

- The program incorporates creative computing elements throughout.
- Early assignments may include creative coding tasks, such as using P5.js to create art inspired by famous painters.
- Real-world examples often draw from the arts, appealing to students working at the intersection of technology and creativity.

### Student Experience

- The program's effectiveness largely depends on individual effort and engagement.
- The hands-on approach ensures learning through practical application, even for less engaged students.

These insights provide a more nuanced view of the program, highlighting its practical focus, creative elements, and potential areas for improvement in advanced theoretical content.
