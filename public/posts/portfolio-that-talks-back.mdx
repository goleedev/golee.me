## Why I Built This

I speak at events. I run a Women in Tech community. I do mentoring sessions. And at almost every one of them, someone asks the same kinds of questions:

_"What stack do you use?"_  
_"Where do you work now?"_  
_"What was that blog post you mentioned?"_

I don't mind answering. But I started wondering —

> What if someone lands on my portfolio at 2am — curious, but with no way to ask me directly?
>
> What if a first-time visitor wants a quick feel for who I am before reaching out?

That's where the idea started.

Not a chatbot for the sake of it. A lightweight assistant that knows me — and can represent me when I'm not around.

## Architecture Decision: RAG vs. Long Context

My first instinct was to do this "properly."

Chunk my knowledge base. Embed everything. Store vectors in a database. Query at runtime. Classic RAG. I even built it — `chunks.json`, 29 chunks, embedding scripts, the works.

Then I stopped and asked myself:

> How much do I actually need to say about myself?

The answer: about 3,000 tokens worth. Llama 3.3 70B supports a 128K context window. 3,000 tokens is nothing. For a bounded, static domain like a single person, retrieval was unnecessary complexity.

So I scrapped the vector database entirely and just put everything directly into the system prompt. No Vectorize. No embeddings. No chunking pipeline. Just a well-structured system prompt.

This is the decision I'm most glad I made. The architecture went from a multi-step retrieval system to a single Worker function. Simpler to build, simpler to maintain, and fast enough for the use case.

## Model Selection: Gemma 3 12B vs. Llama 3.3 70B

Cloudflare Workers AI has a solid catalog. I narrowed it down to two candidates:

|           | Gemma 3 12B   | Llama 3.3 70B fp8-fast      |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Languages | 140 languages | Strong multilingual         |
| Context   | 128K          | 128K                        |
| Quality   | Good          | Excellent                   |
| Speed     | Fast          | Fast (speculative decoding) |

On paper, Gemma 3 12B looks appealing — 140 language support, smaller footprint.

But my actual requirement was specific:  
**Korean, English, and Mandarin Chinese** — and the responses needed to feel natural, not translated.

After testing both side-by-side, Llama 3.3 70B fp8-fast won clearly on Korean fluency and overall response quality. The speculative decoding keeps it fast despite the size.

For a portfolio assistant where quality matters more than cost, it was an easy call.

## Cost: Is It Actually Free?

Workers AI pricing is Neuron-based. The free tier gives you **10,000 Neurons per day**.

```plain
Input:   196 neurons  (7,350 tokens × 26,668 / 1M)
Output:   41 neurons  (  200 tokens × 204,805 / 1M)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:  ~237 neurons/request → ~42 requests/day on the free tier
```

For a portfolio site, 42 meaningful AI interactions per day is plenty.

If traffic spikes, Workers Paid is $5/month and charges $0.011 per 1,000 Neurons above the free allocation.  
For realistic portfolio traffic, that's probably a few dollars a month at most.

## Implementation: Workers + SSE Streaming

SSE (Server-Sent Events) keeps a single HTTP connection open and streams data in chunks as it becomes available — which is how the response appears token by token instead of arriving all at once.

I started with Cloudflare Pages Functions (`functions/api/ask.ts`). It compiled cleanly, the build log said `✨ Compiled Worker successfully`, and everything looked right.

Then every request to `/api/ask` came back 404.

Turns out I already had a separate `golee-api` Worker handling `/api/analytics` and `/api/guestbook` — and it was intercepting all `golee.me/api/*` traffic. Any unrecognized route fell through to `return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 })`.

Pages Functions never got a chance to run.

So I moved `handleAsk` into the existing Worker instead:

```ts
if (url.pathname === '/api/ask') {
  return handleAsk(request, env, corsHeaders);
}
```

The handler itself is straightforward — parse the body, pass history + question to Workers AI, stream the response back:

```ts
async function handleAsk(request, env, corsHeaders) {
  const { question, history } = await request.json();

  const aiResponse = await env.AI.run(
    '@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast',
    {
      stream: true,
      max_tokens: 512,
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: GO_LEE_CONTEXT },
        ...history.slice(-20),
        { role: 'user', content: question },
      ],
    },
  );

  return new Response(aiResponse, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream', ...corsHeaders },
  });
}
```

One thing worth noting: the SSE format from Workers AI differs from the Claude API.

Claude returns:

```json
{
  "type": "content_block_delta",
  "delta": { "type": "text_delta", "text": "..." }
}
```

Workers AI returns:

```json
{ "response": "..." }
```

This subtle difference caused more debugging time than expected. If you're switching between providers, this is the thing that will catch you. The frontend handles both as a fallback:

```ts
if (typeof parsed.response === 'string') {
  accumulated += parsed.response; // Workers AI
}
if (parsed.type === 'content_block_delta') {
  accumulated += parsed.delta.text; // Claude fallback
}
```

Each request also sends the full conversation history so the model can follow along:

```ts
body: JSON.stringify({
  question: resolved,
  history: messages
    .filter((m) => !m.streaming && m.content)
    .map((m) => ({ role: m.role, content: m.content })),
}),
```

The Worker keeps the last 20 turns. In practice most sessions are 2–3 questions, so the free tier holds up fine.

## System Prompt Design

The system prompt carries most of the weight. Here's the core instruction:

```plain
You are an AI assistant on Go Lee's portfolio website (golee.me).
Answer questions about Go Lee using ONLY the context below.
Be warm, concise, and conversational — like a knowledgeable friend, not a resume.
Respond in the SAME language the user writes in (Korean, English, or Chinese).
```

Language handling is done entirely via instruction — no client-side detection, no extra code. The model just mirrors whatever the user writes in, and it works reliably across Korean, English, and Chinese.

For off-topic questions, I wanted personality over a generic refusal. So instead of "I can only answer questions about Go Lee," the assistant responds with something like:

> "Hmm, I'm only here to talk about Go Lee! Not here to get to know her? Bold move. 👀"

The knowledge base also goes beyond career history — it includes things like taking a boat on the Tumen River and saw North Korea just 500m away, watching Friends 20+ times (Monica fan, firmly not Ross), and running annual solo horror marathons. That's what makes it feel like it actually knows the person, not just a LinkedIn profile.

The assistant is live on this site — `Cmd+K` or the Ask button in the top right. Go ahead and try it.

Just don't say you like Ross.
