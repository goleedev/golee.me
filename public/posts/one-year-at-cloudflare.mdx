## Introduction

A year ago, I moved to London and started my journey as a frontend engineer at Cloudflare. I wasn’t sure what it would be like to work at a global company with teams spread across different time zones, nor how easily I’d adjust after years in small, fast-paced startups. What I _did_ know was that I wanted to grow—learn from people with diverse experiences and challenge myself in a new environment.

Looking back, this year has shaped how I think about collaboration, communication, and building systems far more than I expected.

## Finding My Voice in a New Language and New Environment

At the beginning, my impostor syndrome was so strong that the combination of “I don’t know enough yet” and “I have to express all of this in English” felt overwhelming. Until just a few months ago, I used to script almost every sentence before standups or meetings—down to the exact wording—because I didn’t want to stumble, sound unclear, or hold up the discussion. The pressure I put on myself was intense.

That pressure hasn’t disappeared completely, but it has changed. Over time, I learned something important: my teammates care far more about the substance of what I’m trying to say than the perfection of my English. Once I realized that, the weight on my shoulders eased. I stopped aiming for flawless phrasing and instead focused on clarity. Bullet points became enough.

Gradually, this shift opened more space for me to speak naturally. These days, I sometimes come in with no script at all and say things like, “I’m thinking of fixing this bug in this way—what do you think?” It sounds simple, but for me, it reflects a huge change. I feel more comfortable in the room, more present in the conversation, and far more at ease using my own voice.

## Learning to Think in Systems, Not Just Features

Another major shift this year was learning to think beyond building a feature that “just works.” At Cloudflare, even the simplest UI change exists inside a much larger flow and can affect far more teams and users than I was used to. A single update often touches multiple layers of logic, and understanding how those layers interact matters just as much as writing the code.

On my first major task, my buddy walked me through the kinds of questions he naturally considers: what the user sees in less ideal scenarios, how the system behaves under heavy load, and how our future selves will maintain or extend the feature. These weren’t formal checklists—they were simply part of the team’s default way of thinking.

Over time, those questions became part of my own process as well. I began to understand the gap between “making something work for now” and building something that fits seamlessly into a larger system that has to operate reliably at scale. It’s a different kind of thinking—one that influenced not only how I write code, but also how I collaborate.

## Working Across Time Zones and Styles

A big part of that collaboration came from learning to work effectively with a distributed team. With people spread across different time zones, async communication wasn’t just convenient—it was essential. I had to learn how to write clearly, leave enough context for someone to pick something up hours later, and explain decisions in a way that didn’t require a long back-and-forth.

At first, this felt like extra effort. But as I got used to it, I realized how much smoother everything becomes when your thoughts are written down cleanly. Writing forces you to notice gaps you might miss in conversation and helps the whole team move faster without relying on synchronous meetings.

This shift reshaped how I write documentation, how I communicate in PRs, and how I review others’ work. Clear writing turned out to be just as important as clear code.

## Growing Through Trust and Ownership

As I gained confidence, another theme emerged: trust. Even as a newcomer, I was encouraged to own meaningful pieces of work and make decisions instead of waiting for step-by-step direction. That level of autonomy was intimidating at first, but it pushed me to become more thoughtful and more confident in how I approach problems.

Instead of simply implementing a requirement, I had to understand the reasoning behind it, consider alternatives, and think through long-term implications. I wasn’t always sure I was making the right call, but each experience taught me something valuable. That trust—from teammates, my buddy, and the team as a whole—played a huge role in how I grew this year.

## What This Year Meant to Me

When I think about this first year, what stands out isn’t a single major achievement but the accumulation of many small shifts: speaking up a little more, asking clearer questions, writing more intentionally, and seeing systems with a wider lens.

These changes didn’t happen all at once. They happened quietly—in everyday conversations, reviews, and decisions. But taken together, they’ve made me a more grounded and intentional engineer.

## Looking Ahead

As I begin my second year, I’m excited to take on deeper challenges and continue building on what I’ve learned. There’s still a lot I want to improve, but I feel far more prepared than I did a year ago.

This year reminded me that growth doesn’t always come from big moments. Often, it’s the slow, steady accumulation of small improvements—showing up, learning a bit more, and refining how you think and work. I’m grateful for the people who helped me grow, and I’m looking forward to another year of quiet, steady progress.

A year ago, I started this job with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. Today, I can see clearly how much I’ve learned and how much this team has shaped me. Here’s to another year of learning and becoming.
