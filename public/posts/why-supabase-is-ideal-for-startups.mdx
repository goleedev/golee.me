In the dynamic world of startups, selecting the right technology stack can be a game-changer. Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, has emerged as a powerful backend solution uniquely suited to the needs of growing businesses. As someone who has leveraged Supabase in production for nearly a year, I can personally vouch for its effectiveness.

Our journey with Supabase began when we selected it as our core stack for launching our product. This decision was informed by my previous success in developing an MVP using Supabase paired with Next.js. The choice of Supabase was particularly compelling given my prior experience with an AWS-backed MVP at another startup. Despite its limited features and lack of users, that earlier project had incurred costs exceeding $1,000 per month â€“ a significant burden for a pre-launch startup.

This eye-opening experience prompted me to seek more cost-effective alternatives, ultimately leading me to Supabase. Drawing from my hands-on experience and Supabase's comprehensive documentation, I'll explore why this platform stands out as an ideal choice for many startups. Let's dive into the key factors that make Supabase a game-changing solution for entrepreneurs and developers alike.
